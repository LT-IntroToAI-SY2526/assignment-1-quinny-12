# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

My initial experience with Python was pretty smooth and refreshing. Coming from Java and JavaScript, I noticed that Python’s syntax is much cleaner and more straightforward. There’s no need for semicolons, type declarations, or lots of boilerplate code, which made writing simple programs quicker and easier. For example, defining functions and loops felt more concise in Python. However, some Python-specific details like indentation and subtle differences in list operations took a bit of adjustment. Overall, Python felt like it would have been friendly for beginners if you have no previous coding experience. Additionally, the assert statements are great for quickly testing ideas.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I used AI effectively by asking for simple, step-by-step explanations and examples for each Python concept I was learning. For instance, I prompted: “Can you give me simple Python practice problems covering variables, conditionals, loops, and functions?” This helped me get clear, beginner-friendly problems that matched my skill level. Then, I asked for explanations on specific parts I didn’t fully understand, like: “Is ‘return "Hello, ", name, "!"’ valid Python?” The AI provided precise corrections and alternative approaches. Through this, I learned both correct syntax and best practices, like avoiding certain variable names or using built-in functions properly.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

Loops and list operations were the most challenging concepts for me. For example, distinguishing between iterating over elements versus indices in a list confused me at first. AI helped by breaking down the difference between for i in nums: (elements) and for i in range(len(nums)): (indices), with clear code examples. Also, understanding Python’s append() method versus JavaScript’s push() was clarified quickly. Having tailored examples and explanations helped me avoid common beginner mistakes and build confidence in writing loops and manipulating lists.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

I learned that collaborating with AI works best when I treat it as a tutor, not just a code generator. Instead of asking for full solutions outright, I asked for hints, clarifications, or examples of specific parts I struggled with. I also tried writing my own code first, then asked AI to review or debug it, which deepened my understanding. Breaking problems down into smaller pieces and iterating with AI helped me actively engage rather than passively copy answers. This approach made learning more interactive and meaningful.
